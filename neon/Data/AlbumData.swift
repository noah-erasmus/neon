        cover:"ticketsCover",
        description:"Contrary to the hip-hop style of Baker's first four studio albums, Tickets to My Downfall was designed by Baker to be a pop punk album. Baker created a more guitar-driven and live instrument sound in hopes of inspiring a younger generation to learn guitar. He wished to use the sound to branch out to a larger demographic as well, and succeeded, with Baker noting that his own father liked his music for the first time in his career. Tracks 'Bloody Valentine' and 'Concert for Aliens' were both described as 'pop punk', while 'My Ex's Best Friend' was described as having a more modern take on the genre, not quite 'the same 'classic' pop punk vibe'. The album's delay to September 2020 was something Baker felt worked out in the end, as he noted that the album has a summery, good-times vibe that he felt people could appreciate in enduring the COVID-19 lockdowns."

He joined Northlane in 2014, replacing founding vocalist Adrian Fitipaldes. On Alien, his third album with the band, he’s finally ready to tell his story."

Guitars shine like mirror balls, rhythms invite fresh dance-floor poses, and sky-high vocal melodies inspire the kind of sing-alongs that ensure you extra space on the bus. Their penchant for clever wordplay might cause head scratches—cue “Lemon to a Knife Fight” and “Out of My Head” for prime examples—but make perfect sense in The Wombats’ world."
